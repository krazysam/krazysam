### ðŸ‘‹ I'm Sam, Happy to see you!

Living and working in QuÃ©bec, Canada. Been a developper since 2012 and still love all the challenges it can bring me. Mainly work with web technology but always love more the backend side of an application.

- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about : Telerik/Kendo. Been working with it a lot and made some weird custom stuff that work well :) Ask me I'll maybe able to help.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning : Go! Also want to learn other database engine since I pretty much worked only on MSSQL and MySQL.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on : Go project whatever they are. Really what to push my skill on it.
